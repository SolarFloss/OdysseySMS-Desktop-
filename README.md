# OdysseySMS-Desktop-
Desktop application that works with IliadSMS, which is the Android client, that allows me to text from my desktop



When I get a text on my phone, it sends the text to my to my laptop that is listening to a specific port. Once the Odyssey parses the data sent from the Iliad (my phone), it creates a message dialog allowing me to reply quickly
